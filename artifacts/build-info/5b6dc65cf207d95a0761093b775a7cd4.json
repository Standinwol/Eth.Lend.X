TIP: For a detailed writeup see our guide https://forum.openzeppelin.com/t/how-to-implement-erc20-supply-mechanisms/226[How to implement supply mechanisms]. We have followed general OpenZeppelin Contracts guidelines: functions revert instead returning `false` on failure. This behavior is nonetheless conventional and does not conflict with the expectations of ERC20 applications. Additionally, an {Approval} event is emitted on calls to {transferFrom}. This allows applications to reconstruct the allowance for all accounts just by listening to said events. Other implementations of the EIP may not emit these events, as it isn't required by the specification. Finally, the non-standard {decreaseAllowance} and {increaseAllowance} functions have been added to mitigate the well-known issues around setting allowances.

For more information on the signature format, see the https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-2612#specification[relevant EIP section].\"}},\"version\":1},\"userdoc\":{\"kind\":\"user\",\"methods\":{},\"version\":1}},\"settings\":{\"compilationTarget\":{\"@openzeppelin/contracts/token/ERC20/extensions/draft-IERC20Permit.sol\":\"IERC20Permit\"},\"evmVersion\":\"berlin\",\"libraries\":{},\"metadata\":{\"bytecodeHash\":\"ipfs\"},\"optimizer\":{\"enabled\":true,\"runs\":200},\"remappings\":[]},\"sources\":{\"@openzeppelin/contracts/token/ERC20/extensions/draft-IERC20Permit.sol\":{\"keccak256\":\"0xf41ca991f30855bf80ffd11e9347856a517b977f0a6c2d52e6421a99b7840329\",\"license\":\"MIT\",\"urls\":[\"bzz-raw://b2717fd2bdac99daa960a6de500754ea1b932093c946388c381da48658234b95\",\"dweb:/ipfs/QmP6QVMn6UeA3ByahyJbYQr5M6coHKBKsf3ySZSfbyA8R7\"]}},\"version\":1}"}},"@openzeppelin/contracts/token/ERC20/utils/SafeERC20.sol":{"SafeERC20":{"abi":[],"evm":{"bytecode":{"functionDebugData":{},"generatedSources":[],"linkReferences":{},"object":"60566037600b82828239805160001a607314602a57634e487b7160e01b600052600060045260246000fd5b30600052607381538281f3fe73000000000000000000000000000000000000000030146080604052600080fdfea2646970667358221220236510758c900c7ed195d21f34786df886e520cd30783e7e0b034a78af21b72a64736f6c63430008060033","opcodes":"PUSH1 0x56 PUSH1 0x37 PUSH1 0xB DUP3 DUP3 DUP3 CODECOPY DUP1 MLOAD PUSH1 0x0 BYTE PUSH1 0x73 EQ PUSH1 0x2A JUMPI PUSH4 0x4E487B71 PUSH1 0xE0 SHL PUSH1 0x0 MSTORE PUSH1 0x0 PUSH1 0x4 MSTORE PUSH1 0x24 PUSH1 0x0 REVERT JUMPDEST ADDRESS PUSH1 0x0 MSTORE PUSH1 0x73 DUP2 MSTORE8 DUP3 DUP2 RETURN INVALID PUSH20 0x0 ADDRESS EQ PUSH1 0x80 PUSH1 0x40 MSTORE PUSH1 0x0 DUP1 REVERT INVALID LOG2 PUSH5 0x6970667358 0x22 SLT KECCAK256 0x23 PUSH6 0x10758C900C7E 0xD1 SWAP6 0xD2 0x1F CALLVALUE PUSH25 0x6DF886E520CD30783E7E0B034A78AF21B72A64736F6C634300 ADDMOD MOD STOP CALLER ","sourceMap":"707:3748:5:-:0;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;-1:-1:-1;;;707:3748:5;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;"},"deployedBytecode":{"functionDebugData":{},"generatedSources":[],"immutableReferences":{},"linkReferences":{},"object":"73000000000000000000000000000000000000000030146080604052600080fdfea2646970667358221220236510758c900c7ed195d21f34786df886e520cd30783e7e0b034a78af21b72a64736f6c63430008060033","opcodes":"PUSH20 0x0 ADDRESS EQ PUSH1 0x80 PUSH1 0x40 MSTORE PUSH1 0x0 DUP1 REVERT INVALID LOG2 PUSH5 0x6970667358 0x22 SLT KECCAK256 0x23 PUSH6 0x10758C900C7E 0xD1 SWAP6 0xD2 0x1F CALLVALUE PUSH25 0x6DF886E520CD30783E7E0B034A78AF21B72A64736F6C634300 ADDMOD MOD STOP CALLER ","sourceMap":"707:3748:5:-:0;;;;;;;;"},"methodIdentifiers":{}},"metadata":"{\"compiler\":{\"version\":\"0.8.6+commit.11564f7e\"},\"language\":\"Solidity\",\"output\":{\"abi\":[],\"devdoc\":{\"details\":\"Wrappers around ERC20 operations that throw on failure (when the token contract returns false).

Requirements: - `from` and `to` cannot be the zero address. - `from` must have a balance of at least `amount`. - the caller must have allowance for ``from``'s tokens of at least `amount`.\"}},\"version\":1},\"userdoc\":{\"kind\":\"user\",\"methods\":{},\"version\":1}},\"settings\":{\"compilationTarget\":{\"contracts/USDCToken.sol\":\"USDCToken\"},\"evmVersion\":\"berlin\",\"libraries\":{},\"metadata\":{\"bytecodeHash\":\"ipfs\"},\"optimizer\":{\"enabled\":true,\"runs\":200},\"remappings\":[]},\"sources\":{\"@openzeppelin/contracts/token/ERC20/ERC20.sol\":{\"keccak256\":\"0x4ffc0547c02ad22925310c585c0f166f8759e2648a09e9b489100c42f15dd98d\",\"license\":\"MIT\",\"urls\":[\"bzz-raw://15f52f51413a9de1ff191e2f6367c62178e1df7806d7880fe857a98b0b66253d\",\"dweb:/ipfs/QmaQG1fwfgUt5E9nu2cccFiV47B2V78MM1tCy1qB7n4MsH\"]},\"@openzeppelin/contracts/token/ERC20/IERC20.sol\":{\"keccak256\":\"0x9750c6b834f7b43000631af5cc30001c5f547b3ceb3635488f140f60e897ea6b\",\"license\":\"MIT\",\"urls\":[\"bzz-raw://5a7d5b1ef5d8d5889ad2ed89d8619c09383b80b72ab226e0fe7bde1636481e34\",\"dweb:/ipfs/QmebXWgtEfumQGBdVeM6c71McLixYXQP5Bk6kKXuoY4Bmr\"]},\"@openzeppelin/contracts/token/ERC20/extensions/IERC20Metadata.sol\":{\"keccak256\":\"0x8de418a5503946cabe331f35fe242d3201a73f67f77aaeb7110acb1f30423aca\",\"license\":\"MIT\",\"urls\":[\"bzz-raw://5a376d3dda2cb70536c0a45c208b29b34ac560c4cb4f513a42079f96ba47d2dd\",\"dweb:/ipfs/QmZQg6gn1sUpM8wHzwNvSnihumUCAhxD119MpXeKp8B9s8\"]},\"@openzeppelin/contracts/utils/Context.sol\":{\"keccak256\":\"0xe2e337e6dde9ef6b680e07338c493ebea1b5fd09b43424112868e9cc1706bca7\",\"license\":\"MIT\",\"urls\":[\"bzz-raw://6df0ddf21ce9f58271bdfaa85cde98b200ef242a05a3f85c2bc10a8294800a92\",\"dweb:/ipfs/QmRK2Y5Yc6BK7tGKkgsgn3aJEQGi5aakeSPZvS65PV8Xp3\"]},\"contracts/USDCToken.sol\":{\"keccak256\":\"0x112bcb229a3a81b5a0f66fea0e3ced237e9a174901173d4c7a0a9ecd55d01081\",\"license\":\"MIT\",\"urls\":[\"bzz-raw://b9eb33304fa3975d6ea21c83ebaba20b66a065a7f835f231873df0d1a977c2e5\",\"dweb:/ipfs/QmcVBzPvRFxJ9t3Ai8EdBQSd6STLpH9pERrjFp1Pp588sZ\"]}},\"version\":1}"}}}}}
