# Vercel Deployment Guide for Eth.Lend.X

## Prerequisites

1. **Vercel Account**: Sign up at [vercel.com](https://vercel.com)
2. **GitHub Repository**: Push your code to GitHub
3. **Environment Variables**: Prepare your environment variables

## Deployment Steps

### 1. Connect Repository to Vercel

1. Go to [vercel.com/dashboard](https://vercel.com/dashboard)
2. Click "New Project"
3. Import your GitHub repository
4. Vercel will automatically detect it's a Next.js project

### 2. Configure Environment Variables

In your Vercel project dashboard, go to Settings > Environment Variables and add:

```
NEXT_PUBLIC_INFURA_API_URL=https://sepolia.infura.io/v3/YOUR_PROJECT_ID
NEXT_PUBLIC_LENDING_POOL_ADDRESS=your_deployed_contract_address
NEXT_PUBLIC_LENDING_HELPER_ADDRESS=your_deployed_contract_address
NEXT_PUBLIC_LENDING_CONFIG_ADDRESS=your_deployed_contract_address
NEXT_PUBLIC_ADDRESS_TO_TOKEN_MAP_ADDRESS=your_deployed_contract_address
NEXT_PUBLIC_DAI_TOKEN_ADDRESS=your_deployed_contract_address
NEXT_PUBLIC_USDC_TOKEN_ADDRESS=your_deployed_contract_address
NEXT_PUBLIC_LINK_TOKEN_ADDRESS=your_deployed_contract_address
NEXT_PUBLIC_NETWORK_ID=11155111
NEXT_PUBLIC_NETWORK_NAME=sepolia
```

### 3. Deploy Smart Contracts First

Before deploying to Vercel, make sure your smart contracts are deployed to Sepolia:

```bash
# Deploy to Sepolia testnet
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy-sepolia.js --network sepolia
```

Copy the deployed contract addresses and update your environment variables in Vercel.

### 4. Deploy to Vercel

#### Option A: Automatic Deployment
- Push your code to GitHub
- Vercel will automatically deploy on every push to main branch

#### Option B: Manual Deployment via CLI
```bash
# Install Vercel CLI
npm i -g vercel

# Login to Vercel
vercel login

# Deploy
vercel --prod
```

### 5. Update Contract Addresses

After deploying your contracts, update the `addresses.js` file with your deployed contract addresses and push the changes. Vercel will automatically redeploy.

## Build Configuration

The project is now configured with:

- **Next.js optimizations** for production builds
- **Webpack polyfills** for Web3 libraries
- **Environment variable handling** for different environments
- **Proper build scripts** for Vercel

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:

1. **Build Failures**: Check the build logs in Vercel dashboard
2. **Environment Variables**: Ensure all required variables are set
3. **Contract Addresses**: Make sure contract addresses are correct
4. **Network Issues**: Verify your Infura/Alchemy API key is valid

### Build Command Override (if needed):

If you need to override the build command in Vercel:
- Go to Project Settings > Build & Output Settings
- Set Build Command to: `npm run vercel-build`

## Post-Deployment

1. Test all functionality on the deployed site
2. Verify MetaMask connection works
3. Test lending and borrowing features
4. Monitor for any console errors

## Custom Domain (Optional)

1. Go to Project Settings > Domains
2. Add your custom domain
3. Configure DNS records as instructed by Vercel
